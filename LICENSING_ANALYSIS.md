## 1. Executive Summary

We have identified **500 distinct content sources** from our database of 4.4M educational YouTube videos. These sources span universities, government agencies, MOOCs, conferences, coaching centers, and individual educators across 20+ countries.

### Key Findings

- **~39,000 videos** come from **NPTEL/IIT sources** (Indian government-funded, likely CC-BY-SA 4.0)
- **~55,000 videos** are classified as **green (low risk)** — already under Creative Commons or public domain
- **~4M videos** are **yellow (moderate risk)** — standard YouTube license, need outreach
- **~304,000 videos** are **orange (elevated risk)** — commercial/copyrighted content
- **~47,000 videos** are **red (high risk)** — gaming/entertainment, should be excluded

### Licensing Strategy Summary

|----------|--------|----------|
| Already CC-licensed (green) | 55,422 | Use with attribution, no outreach needed |
| Government/public (yellow-safe) | ~50,000 | Contact govt agencies for bulk permission |
| University OCW (yellow) | ~500,000 | Contact ~50 universities for written permission |
| NPTEL/SWAYAM (India govt) | ~39,000 | Single contact point: NPTEL/MHRD |
| Coaching/commercial (orange) | ~304,000 | Lower priority, fair use argument stronger |
| Entertainment (red) | 47,462 | Exclude from dataset |

### For Universities with OCW Programs

```
Subject: Licensing Request for Educational Transcription Project

Dear [OCW Office / Department Head],

I am writing regarding [University]'s educational video content available on YouTube 
through [specific channel name].

We are building an open educational transcription dataset — a large-scale collection 
of high-quality transcriptions of academic lectures and educational content. Our goal 
is to make educational content more accessible through accurate, searchable transcripts 
that can benefit:

- Students with hearing disabilities
- Non-native English speakers
- Researchers studying educational content
- AI/ML training for educational applications

We have identified approximately [X] videos from [University/Channel] in our database. 
We understand your content is published under [license type]. We would like to:

1. Confirm that our transcription and inclusion in our dataset is compatible with 
   your licensing terms
2. Obtain written permission to include these transcriptions in our published dataset
3. Ensure proper attribution per your requirements

Our project:
- Transcribes educational videos using AI (Whisper-based models)
- Publishes transcriptions with full attribution to the original source
- Does NOT redistribute the original video or audio content
- Aims to enhance accessibility and educational value

We would be happy to:
- Provide you with copies of all transcriptions of your content
- Add specific attribution text you require
- Remove any content you prefer not to include
- Sign a formal licensing agreement if needed

Would you be available for a brief call to discuss this? I'm happy to provide 
more details about our project and how your content would be used.

Thank you for making educational content openly available.

Best regards,
George [Last Name]

Subject: Educational Transcription Project — Content Licensing Inquiry

Dear [Agency Contact],

I am writing regarding the educational video content produced by [Agency] and 
available on YouTube. As a [government-funded / public institution] producing 
educational content for public benefit, we believe our project aligns well with 
your mission.

[Rest similar to above, but emphasizing public benefit alignment and 
government open access policies]

## 6. Fair Use Legal Framework

### The Four Factors of Fair Use (17 U.S.C. § 107)

#### Factor 1: Purpose and Character of Use

**Our argument: STRONGLY FAVORABLE**

- **Transformative use:** We are creating transcriptions (text) from audio/video — a fundamentally different format and use case
- **Educational/research purpose:** The dataset serves accessibility, education, and research
- **Non-commercial (if applicable):** If released as open dataset for research
- **Added value:** Transcriptions add searchability, accessibility (deaf/HoH), and enable text-based analysis that the original videos don't provide

#### Factor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

**Our argument: FAVORABLE**

- **Factual content:** Educational lectures primarily convey facts, theories, and knowledge — which receive less copyright protection than creative/artistic works
- **Published works:** All content is publicly available on YouTube
- **Educational intent:** Original creators intended wide dissemination for learning

#### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

**Our argument: MIXED**

- **Full transcription:** We transcribe entire videos, which weighs against fair use
- **Different medium:** However, text transcription captures only the verbal content, not visual demonstrations, slides, animations, or the audiovisual experience
- **Mitigation:** We do NOT redistribute the original audio or video files

#### Factor 4: Effect on the Market

**Our argument: FAVORABLE**

- **No market substitution:** A text transcript does not substitute for watching the lecture video
- **Complementary:** Transcriptions may actually INCREASE viewership by making content discoverable
- **No competing product:** We are not creating a competing educational platform
- **Enhancement:** Accessibility improvements serve the original educational mission

### Overall Fair Use Assessment

For **educational/factual content** (university lectures, conference talks): **Strong fair use case**
For **commercial content** (paid courses, entertainment): **Weaker fair use case**
For **CC-licensed content**: **No fair use needed** — just comply with CC terms

### Risk Stratification

| Content Type | Fair Use Strength | Recommended Action |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CC-BY-SA/CC-BY-NC-SA content | N/A (licensed) | Use with attribution |
| Public domain / govt | N/A (free) | Use freely |
| University OCW (Standard YT) | Strong | Get written permission anyway |
| Conference talks | Strong | Contact organizers |
| Corporate talks (AWS, Google) | Moderate | Contact for permission |
| Individual educators | Moderate | Contact individually |
| Coaching/test prep | Weak-Moderate | Lower priority |
| Entertainment/gaming | Weak | Exclude |

## 7. Recommended Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Confirm & Attribute (Week 1-2)
**No outreach needed — just verify and comply**

1. **NPTEL content (~39,000 videos)** — Confirm CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, add proper attribution
2. **Khan Academy (8,530 videos)** — Comply with CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0
3. **Taiwan OCW (14,614 videos)** — Confirm CC terms, attribute
4. **Library of Congress (5,336 videos)** — Verify public domain status
5. **SWAYAM (3,963 videos)** — Confirm CC-BY-SA
6. **Yale OYC** — Confirm CC-BY-NC-SA for Open Yale Courses specifically
7. **MIT OCW** — Confirm CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0

**Estimated immediately usable: ~72,000+ videos**

### Phase 2: High-Impact University Outreach (Week 2-4)
**Contact 15-20 universities with largest video counts**

Priority order:
1. **CEC/UGC India** (~21,000 videos) — Single government contact
2. **CUNY** (10,023 videos) — Public university, favorable
3. **IIT system** (for non-NPTEL content) — Confirm NPTEL scope
4. **Harvard** (~1,800 videos) — Multiple departments
5. **Stanford** (~2,000 videos) — Stanford Online, CME
6. **Berkeley** (~1,500 videos) — CS dept especially
7. **Cambridge** (~2,000 videos) — Law, Press
8. **Oxford** (~2,000 videos) — Said, Martin School
9. **Bar-Ilan University** (3,858 videos) — Single institution
10. **MIPT Moscow** (4,156 videos) — Single institution

### Phase 3: Conference & Corporate (Week 4-6)
**Batch outreach to organizations**

1. **AWS Events** (10,123 videos) — aws.amazon.com/events
2. **Talks at Google** (5,325 videos) — Google corporate
3. **Microsoft Research** (8,909 videos) — microsoft.com/research
